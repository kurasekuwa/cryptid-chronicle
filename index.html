      <!-- FIRST TEXT SECTION -->
      <p>
        This is where the first part of your monster report goes. Describe the sighting, location, and the strange details witnesses noticed. Was there a strange sound? Glowing eyes? Footprints that vanished mid‑trail?
      </p>

      <p>
        Add more detail here. News-style writing works best: who saw it, when it happened, and why people think this creature might be something not of this world.
      </p>

      <!-- SECOND TEXT SECTION -->
      <p>
        Use this section for follow-up information. Maybe an expert weighed in, or locals shared older legends that match the description. You can also include "official" denials for dramatic effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finish with an open-ended mystery to keep readers hooked for the next report from the Cryptid Chronicle.
