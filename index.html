        <h2>Mountain Creature "Zahrek" Photographed Outside Pokhara Home</h2>

          What was supposed to be a normal trip back home turned into a horrifying sight for 39-year old Sushil KC. He reported the chilling encounter late Tuesday night after returning home to find what he described as “one of them” running frantically and "withering away" in his front yard until he had saw it. The description of the creature perfectly matches the recent influx in the pervasive invasion of the "Zahrek" in urban areas: the decaying snow-covered 7ft tall body with 2 large wings of just bones and its spine exposed running frantically almost like it is trying to get attention from somebody. KC passed out from this encounter, but it is safe to say he will remember his encounter with this Zahrek.

          KC is certainly fortunate to have seen the creature this early in its decay. Generally, Zahrek do not typically attack us humans. Other reports have stated that the more frantic Zahrek are certainly more hostile with a lot less body. There have also been reports of these monsters ditching their body completely and entering into a human body when they sleep almost like a tapeworm and living in their mind like a parasite. They will then live as the person and make every future decision related to the well-being of the Zahrek.

        <h2>Shadow Figure Caught on Downtown Security Camera</h2>

          A late-night security recording appears to show a tall, distorted figure moving between buildings without casting a shadow of its own.

        <p>
          Video analysts are divided, with some calling it a glitch and others saying the movement "does not match human motion patterns."
